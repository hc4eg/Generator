This directory contains files for generating events for
the BetheHeitler pair production spectrometer GEANT4 simulation.

Code has been tested on a 64 bit machine running
CentOS 7 using  
gcc (GCC) 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-11)
Generating 250000 events takes about 24 hours.
So using the 4 cores on my machine I can generate about
a million events every 24 hours.


It contains two parts:
1) The library for calculating the cross sections.
2) The code for generating event file for input to the simulation.

1) The library is in the directory BH_cross_sections
This is based on code provided by milstein alexander <milsteinsasha@yandex.ru>

To build:
> cd BH_cross_sections
> cmake .
> make
> cd ..

The library libBH_cross_sections.so should remain in the
directory BH_cross_sections.

2) The event generator code is in the directory generator.

To build:
> cd generator
> cmake .
> make

The code name "generate" will be produced.

To run the code type:
> generate <events>

where <events> is the number of events you want it to generate.

Each time generate is run it produces a unique set of output file
labeled with a run number.

The file "events.run001.dat" is the events in the format expected
by the GEANT4 simulation, one event per line.

The file "output.run001.dat" is a running status of the run.
At the beginning is a list of the run parameters.
The a status line is written and every N events are generated
indicating how long it has taken and other info.
N is currently set to 1000.
This file should be scanned for any lines such as...
Cross Section = 4.3603056e-06 > maximum cross section = 4e-06
This would indicate that the maximum cross section variable in the
code is set too low. Any events generate by such a run should be
discarded as unreliable.
The variable to change in generate.cpp is "maximum_xsec".
Currently it is set to 5.e-6 which seem appropriate for
the minimum polar angle of 4 degrees.
Setting maximum_xsec too high will significantly increase the time
needed to generate events.

Each time generate is run it increments the run number
which is stored in the file "events.runno". If you want
run several generate instances, starting in the same directory, they
should be started sequentially (so the number in events.runno
is incremented before the next generate starts running).

All files written by an instance of generate are written to the 
directory in which it is started.
